# monkParakeetsPopulationsByComunaBuenosAires
Combined a shapefile of Buenos Aires comunas with latitude / longitude coordinates of monk parakeets recorded on the iNaturalist app to create a chloropeth map of monk parakeet populations

This project could be used with other animal data found on the iNaturalist app or any other shapefiles attainable.  The project plots the shapefile by incorporating population data as a column and uses this to create the choropleth map.
